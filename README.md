# TeamGenerator


* Used the [Inquirer npm package] to prompt the user for their email, id, and specific information based on their role with the company. An intern provides school,  an engineer provides GitHub username, manager provides the office number.

* The application prompts the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. This assignment  also passed all unit tests.
